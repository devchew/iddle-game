This library provides access to shared configuration for the IdleFactory project. The configuration is stored in YAML files and converted to JSON at build time.

```typescript
import { entities, researchTree } from "@iddle-factory/config";

// Access entities configuration directly
console.log(entities.entities[0].name); // "Podstawowa kopalnia"

// Access research tree configuration directly
console.log(researchTree.tiers[0].upgrades[0].name); // "Efektywne g√≥rnictwo"
```

- `SciencePacks` - The science packs required for research
- `Upgrade` - A research upgrade
